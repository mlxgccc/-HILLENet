Note that the results in the ablation study were obtained using images cropped to 256×256, a batch size of 2, and 1000 training epochs. Minor differences in PSNR, SSIM, or LPIPS compared with the main comparison tables are due to this experimental setting. Despite these differences, the ablation results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules and design choices.
